Tested with [multiple Linux and other clients](https://github.com/Serialcomms/zeptoforth-usb-linux/blob/main/documents/test_matrix.md)  

Very good upload performance with Minicom and [GTKTerm](https://github.com/Serialcomms/zeptoforth-usb-linux/blob/main/screenshots/GTK_Term_timestamps.png) clients
